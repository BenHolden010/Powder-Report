# Powder Report
the App is deployed to this link: https://powder-report.vercel.app/
## ABSTRACT
'Powder Report' is a web application designed to provide users with millions of Snow Reports from any country in the world. Through an intuitive interface, users can effortlessly type a location and the App will either find the location and display the snow report or display an error message if that location was not found. 'Powder Report' offers users the ability to add locations to a saved location page to compare reports side by side to determine the best resort to go to for fresh powder. if a user decides that they no longer need any of the reports then they can remove the report using a delete button. this information will only be stored while the user has not refreshed the application's page. 

## LEARNING GOALS
- Gain competency in react fundamentals and apply React and Cypress concepts effectively.
- Develop proficiency in testing React components and asynchronous JavaScript code, including the use of Cypress for end-to-end testing.
- Practice refactoring techniques to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability.
- Create a multi-page user experience using React Router to handle routing and navigation.
- Apply real-world API integration and handle network requests, including error handling and data fetching.
- Keeping track of a users saved reports and enabling them to delete their reports indevidually.

## WINS/CHALLENGES 
### WINS
- Being able to successfully learn and implement React within a few weeks to develop a comprehensive application by myself.
- Effective use of React to create a dynamic and interactive user interface, allowing users to navigate through different views and components.
- Utilization of React Router to handle routing and enable multi-page functionality, enhancing the user experience.

### CHALLENGES
- trying to get the post API to work was holding me up for an hour until i figured out that the error was occuring because of a typo in the fetch request.
- nested data sets were hard to navigate but were very dynamic when it came to displaying data that needed to be mapped over.
- It was a challenge to have to find an API on our own and then work with it until our code was able to manipulate the returned data in a way that is user friendly.
